    "* **What's the project about? What problem are you solving?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data on people killed by police from 2013-2016, can we understand what variables make a person more or less likely to be fatally injured by a police officer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset only includes people who died from police action, so we are unable to predict survival rate (since in all cases, survival = false). However, we can use the data set to predict the victim's race, conditional on dying. We can also use the data set to predict whether the victim was armed or unarmed, conditional on dying. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the machine learning applications for this data would be towards predicting a binary variable (armed or unarmed) or categorical variable (race 1, race 2, race 3, etc). These are both classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try the following classification models to determine which variables are best able to predict the outcomes (armed/unarmed or race category):\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbors (lesson 9)\n",
    "Logistic regression (lesson 10)\n",
    "Decision trees (lesson 11) - will show us feature importance\n",
    "Random forest, bagging (lesson 12)\n",
    "Clustering (lesson 14) - to see if there are trends/groupings in the data without necessarily predicting an outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "I will score the models using accuracy, precision/recall, f1, or auc roc score, depending on which is most appropriate for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What kind of impact do you think it could have?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis on this data could prove or disprove any overt or subtle raical bias by police officers. In addition, the analysis could help US police departments improve transparency and accountability, and could help activists and police departments to work together and end police violence. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?**\n",

It seems like there's not a strong predictive component here - whereas you could try to \"predict the person's race\", for example, from other features in the dataset, since those features obviously aren't _causing_ a change in the person's race, that analysis would end up being more exploratory than anything. Of course, if you had survival rates here, then this would be a perfect case for a predictive model, but unfortunately we don't.\n",
